# KhaoChan: Thailand News In Short

KhaoChan is a Django-based web application that provides quick, bite-sized summaries of Thai news. Each summary is a concise (around 30-word) digest of the original article, making it easy for busy expats, locals, and travelers to stay updated on Thailand's current events without reading lengthy articles.

## Features

- **Concise News Summaries:** Quick overviews that distill each article into approximately 30 words.
- **Responsive Design:** A clean, mobile-friendly UI for easy reading on any device.
- **Admin Panel Integration:** Use Django's built-in admin to easily manage and update news items.
- **Direct Source Linking:** Each summary includes a link to the full article on the original publication.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python and Django
- **Database:** SQLite for development (upgrade to PostgreSQL in production)
- **Frontend:** Django Templates with a CSS framework (Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS recommended)
- **Hosting:** Deployable on low-cost VPS services (e.g., DigitalOcean, Linode, Hetzner)
